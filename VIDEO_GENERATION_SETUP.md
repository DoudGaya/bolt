## Fallback Behavior

If no video generation services are configured, the system will:
1. Generate a comprehensive video script
2. Create an HTML video template
3. Use a demo video URL for preview purposes

## Testing Video Generation

To test video generation:
1. Set up at least one video service API key
2. Go to Dashboard â†’ Generate Content
3. Select "Video" as content type
4. Fill out the form and generate
5. The system will attempt real video generation and fall back to script if needed

## Important Notes

- Video generation can take 2-10 minutes depending on the service
- Costs vary by service - check their pricing pages
- All generated videos are automatically uploaded to your S3 bucket
- The content library will show video previews with playback controls

## Environment Variables Summary

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Required for all functionality
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
